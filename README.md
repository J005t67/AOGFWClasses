# AOGFWClasses
AOG firmware in classes

## Goals

- A starting point towards merging the code for CANBUS and AIO firmwares
- Make it easier to extend to support new kit (eg UM982 GPS, Keya etc)
- try and make it so I can understand it a bit better (as I struggle with it as it currently is)

Learning C++ as I go - poorly, probably. All feedback welcome.
